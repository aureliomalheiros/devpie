## Objective:
Develop a tool to enhance developer efficiency and experience by integrating with major cloud platforms and Git version control systems. The tool will utilize a YAML file for configuration to automate the build and integration process, providing ease and consistency.

## Key Features:

1. **Integration with Major Clouds:**
   - Support for integration with major cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
   - Cloud resource management, enabling the creation and configuration of instances, services, and environments.

2. **Integration with Git Controllers:**
   - Support for major Git version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
   - Automation of CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) processes directly from the Git repository.

3. **Configurable YAML File:**
   - Utilization of a YAML file to define project configurations, allowing easy customization.
   - Configuration of environments, environment variables, dependencies, and build scripts.

4. **DORA Metrics:**
   - Implementation of the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics model for evaluating performance in development and continuous delivery processes.
   - Automatic collection and reporting of metrics such as lead time, cycle time, change success rate, and recovery time.

5. **Automatic Build Pipeline:**
   - Automatic construction of the development environment based on configurations provided in the YAML file.
   - Execution of build, test, and deployment scripts according to project specifications.

6. **Notifications and Monitoring:**
   - Integration with notification systems for real-time alerts and monitoring.
   - Monitoring of performance metrics throughout the development lifecycle.

## Technical Requirements:

1. **Programming Language:** Preferably, the tool will be developed in a language that supports interoperability with APIs from major clouds and Git platforms.

2. **Cloud and Git APIs:** Integration with specific APIs for clouds and Git controllers to facilitate automation.

3. **YAML Parser:** Use of a library or tool for analyzing and interpreting the YAML configuration file.

4. **Metrics Collection Modules:** Implementation of specific modules for collecting and processing metrics according to the DORA model.

5. **Security:** Implementation of security practices to protect sensitive information and ensure the integrity of the development process.

## Future Development:
Consider expanding the tool to support new clouds, Git controllers, and additional metrics, always prioritizing flexibility and ease of configuration.

**Note:** This is an initial scope and can be adjusted based on the specific needs of the project and users.
